### To-do:
1. **Game_window.py** - Add hard mode which will include given code where you should fill in or fix code
2. **Seed_challenges** - Here you should add weekly challenges(about, xp and items gain for them and 2nd leaderboard)
                            Everything for the weekly challenges is ready in DB(use challenges window)
3. **settings_window** - Well, I did nothing to it, I think that's good to do something like sound effects or whatever
                            (I would recommend to add password change and profile icon)
